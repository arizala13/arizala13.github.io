			<ol>Basketball</ol>
				<p>I am a huge Houston Rockets fan. I grew up watching them with my two brothers and Dad. Whenever possible I love watching a game in person. Here is a picture of myself and Vernon Maxwell and Calvin Murphy. </p>

				<p>I really enjoy playing basketball whenever possible. It doesnt matter if it is one on one or a pick up game in the gym, I love the competition.</p>
			<ol>Weight lifting</ul>
				<p>I love going to the gym. I usually train Monday-Thursday and Friday and Saturday go for a run outside. On Sundays I do my best to make it to the gym to play basketball.</p>

		<li>Books</li>
			<p>I usually am always reading at least one book. I like non-fiction and self help books. Stephen king and Tony Robbins are two of my favorite authors. </p>
