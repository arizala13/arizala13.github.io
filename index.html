	<h5>Here are some random stoic quotes to ponder.</h5>
		<div class="scroll">
		“True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.” 
		― Seneca <br>
		“Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.” 
			― Seneca <br>
		“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” 
		― Seneca <br>
		“All cruelty springs from weakness.” 
		― Seneca <br>
		“Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.” 
		― Marcus Aurelius <br>
		“It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more.” 
		― Seneca <br>
		“What really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves, but the way in which we think about them. It is not things that disturb us, but our interpretation of their significance.” 
		― Epictetus <br>
